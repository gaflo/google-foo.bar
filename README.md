# google-foo.bar
My submissions for the foo.bar programming challenges made by Google. All programs are written in Python 2.7 (as used in the sandbox for testing the different examples).

If there is interest, I can provide the unit tests I made to assert whether my programs were working correctly while I was making them.

Currently the next step on this repository would be to annotate and explain the solutions.
