# google-foo.bar
My submissions for the foo.bar programming challenges made by Google. All programs are written in Python 2.7 (as used in the sandbox for testing the different examples).

If there is interest, I can provide the unit tests I made to assert whether my programs were working correctly while I was making them.

Currently there is only one level included; will update with more once I got the time to write descriptions (I don't think just uploading the solution is of much value).
